Changing "Hospital#1" etc.

1. Create vector with the changes
hospital_names <- c(
                    `Hospital#1` = "Some Hospital",
                    `Hospital#2` = "Another Hospital",
                    `Hospital#3` = "Hospital Number 3",
                    `Hospital#4` = "The Other Hospital"
                    )

2. Add as a labeller function
facet_wrap(hospital ~ ., labeller = as_labeller(hospital_names))
